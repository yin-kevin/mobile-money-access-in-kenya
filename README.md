This is a coding sample for an pre-doctoral applications in economics. The code was written as part of my research with a group of students from the University of Toronto studying mobile money in Kenya and the barriers to last mile financial inclusion. It includes data cleaning, linear regression and regularized logistic regression to predict non-users of mobile money in Kenya. Our research on this topic is part of a broader initiative at the university called the Reach Alliance at the Munk School of Public Policy.
