\textbf{Introduction}

This is a coding sample for pre-doctoral applications in economics. The code was written as part of my research with a group of students from the University of Toronto studying mobile money in Kenya and the barriers to last mile financial inclusion. Here I use FSD-Kenya household-level survey data to identify the socioeconomic characteristics that correlate with, and predict, a person's likelihood of failing to be reached by mobile money services. It includes data cleaning, linear regression and regularized logistic regression to predict non-users. We were interested in non-users as opposed to users in alignment with the theme of understanding minority populations that are left behind by social interventions. 

Our research on this topic is part of a broader initiative at the university called the
[Reach Alliance](http://reachalliance.org/) at the Munk School of Public Policy which seeks to understand the ways we can get to these 'hardest-to-reach' populations.
